      <description>Saturday 29 and Sunday 30 September 2018 , B.USOC and Space Pole in Uccle (Brussels) opened doors to the public. People saw a little operations centre with timeline , tools example and videos of ASIM and FSL project.
  B.USOC team was available to explain and reply to questions about B.USOC and projects : FSL and ASIM.
  The models of SOLAR, ASIM and GEOFLOW of FSL were exposed.</description>

      <description>ASIM (Atmosphere-Space Interactions Monitor) was arrived on April 13, 2018 on the International Space Station (ISS).
This instrument can observe TLE (transient luminous events) and TGF ( Terrestrial gamma-ray flashes ) for a better understanding of the influence of violent storms on the atmosphere and the climate on Earth.
B.USOC is the ESA responsible center for the ASIM infrastructure :
 receiving the telemetries, monitoring the instrument delivering the data to ASIM Science Data Centre in Denmark.</description>

      <description>Astronaut Thomas Pesquet took impressive photos of Europe from space with Belgium up and Warsaw below. We also see aurora borealis in the background. It denounces the waste of light pollution in Belgium: with 186 bulbs per square mile even on small country roads, the country is the leader unrivalled in Western Europe. Beside, France seems to have been cast in the darkness. Thomas Pesquet returns to Earth on June 2.</description>

      <description>Science is running again on FSL! The Fluid Science Laboratory, onboard Columbus, was failing to downlink High Rate data for quite some time.
But yesterday, a workaround to get scientific videos on the ground was finally put in place and tested successfully with the Geoflow experiment, thanks to the perseverance and dedication of B.USOC engineers, professionalism of Airbus (Bremen) and of the Spanish USOC (E.USOC), and the great support and flexibility of the Columbus Control Centre.</description>

      <description>On April 29, British astronaut Tim Peake drove a rover named Bridget in the Mars Yard at Stevenage, UK from the International Space Station as part of the METERON project that is preparing for future human-robotic missions to the Moon, Mars and beyond. He had the challenging task of driving a rover across a sandpit that resembles the Martian surface. Bridget is a development model of the ESA EXOMARS mission.</description>

      <description>This Observatory onboard the ISS is tracking the Sun now for more than 8 years!
The instrument was designed to work for only 18 months, but it is still running â€“ its operation is exceeding all expectations. Launched at the 2008 minimum of solar cycle 23, it observed the also the maximum of solar cycle 24 in 2015 and now is still active in the decrease phase. Solar energy input to the earth atmosphere and its variations are a major factor in the climate models and are accurately monitored only since the beginning of the space age.</description>

The three first ISS astronauts were : William Shepherd (commander, NASA), Sergei K.Krikalev (RSA) et Yuri Gidzenko (RSA). They prepared the station for further occupations and began the science programme of the ISS, since them a rotating cast of more than 220 of the world&amp;rsquo;s elite astronauts have lived and worked at the ISS, which includes 16 participating nations and is led by the United States and Russia.</description>

      <description>April 21, 2015: first command sent to B.USOC to the ISS Fluid Science Laboratory (FSL).
In the morning of April 21, the B.USOC team successfully activated the FSL module in COLUMBUS and both sent test commands and received ancillary data leading to the start of a new activity in B.USOC. This successful end to end test prepares future science operations and is currently analysed in details.</description>

      <description>SOLAR on the ISS will observe the March 20 eclipse on the sun.
On March 20, there will be a coincidence between the International Space Station orbit and the path of the solar eclipse in Northern Africa. The SOLAR package on the ESA COLUMBUS module of the ISS will observe it. SOLAR operates for 7 years in earth orbit and measures the energy emitted by the sun for the far ultraviolet to the infrared in order to monitor the solar influence on atmospheric chemistry and climate.</description>

These exploration targets are the future of manned exploration. The first unmanned test flight will take place in December this year from NASA Kennedy Space Center to recovery at sea in the Pacific Ocean.
Even without a payload we can participate by having NASA write our name on a memory chip which will be carried by ORION</description>

After the successful OPSCOM-2 test of August 7, ESA released a video showing the complex operations of the EUROBOT in ESTEC commanded by astronaut Alexander Gerst from the ISS using the Disruptive/Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) communication protocol.
METERON is a programme common to the ISS space agencies: NASA, ESA, Roscosmos and DLR developing the technology necessary for this objective by commanding a robot on earth by an astronaut on the ISS.</description>

      <description>Future human space exploration will most likely involve sending robots to explore the planetary surface, in preparation and support of the on-site exploration by humans.
The Meteron project is exactly preparing for that future. Use of robots will continue even when humans have safely landed for both astronaut support and planetary protection of â€œspecial regionsâ€ defined by the international treaties as hospitable for elementary life. Controlling the robots, even for short distances, would require a form of reliable internet to send commands and to receive information back.</description>

      <description>The SOLAR payload, located on one of the four external platforms of the Columbus module on the International Space Station, is active since February 2008 and measures the solar spectral irradiance with two instruments : SOLSPEC which covers the spectral range of the Ultra-Violet (UV) to the near infrared and SOL-ACES, a set of spectrometers measuring the Extreme UV radiation (EUV).
Due to the characteristics of the ISS orbit and the mechanical limitations for the platform, at most 20 minutes of measurements are possible per ISS revolution, and this for only 10 to 12 consecutive days per month.</description>

      <description>ASIM is an ISS science payload aimed principally at the observation of Transitory Light Events (TLE) occurring over intense thunderstorms lightning. ASIM observes also TGF’s (terrestrial gamma rays flashes which are also related to strong lightning. It has been proposed by the Danish scientist Torsten Neubert and is due for launch in 2016. B.USOC is Facility Responsible Centre (FRC) for this payload.
The ASIM mission constitutes of a package of two nadir instruments : one for the visible and another for the X ray and radio frequencies, the normal operating mode is a trigger mode where both instruments are continuously measuring but do not record data below thresholds to be determined by the science team.</description>

      <description>The ISS astronauts stopped an ammonia leak in the ISS external cooling loop by replacing a suspected pump unit by the spare one and checking all connections on Saturday May 11.
http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition35/e35_051113_eva.html
This leak had appeared on May 9 and posed a threat to the ISS power conditioning as the main function of this cooling loop is to control the temperature of the electrical motors moving the solar panels. The coolant lines will have to be monitored for several weeks before it is certain that the leak has been fully fixed by the replacement and maintenance EVA of May 11.</description>

Between 19h00 and 22h30, SOLSPEC, in Earth-orbit on the ISS, and SPICAV, in Venus-orbit on Venus Express, were simultaneously observing the sun. The goal of this synchronisation is to perform an absolute calibration of SPICAV.
SOLSPEC is part of the SOLAR payload, mounted on the exterior of the Columbus Module of the ISS and operated by B.</description>
