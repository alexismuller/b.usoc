      <description>Astronaut Thomas Pesquet took impressive photos of Europe from space with Belgium up and Warsaw below. We also see aurora borealis in the background. It denounces the waste of light pollution in Belgium: with 186 bulbs per square mile even on small country roads, the country is the leader unrivalled in Western Europe. Beside, France seems to have been cast in the darkness. Thomas Pesquet returns to Earth on June 2.</description>

      <description>This Observatory onboard the ISS is tracking the Sun now for more than 8 years!
The instrument was designed to work for only 18 months, but it is still running â€“ its operation is exceeding all expectations. Launched at the 2008 minimum of solar cycle 23, it observed the also the maximum of solar cycle 24 in 2015 and now is still active in the decrease phase. Solar energy input to the earth atmosphere and its variations are a major factor in the climate models and are accurately monitored only since the beginning of the space age.</description>

      <description>The SOLAR package was active during the March 8 eclipse over Indonesia and measured the progressive dimming of the sun by the moon in three wavelengths, this observation is of course non nominal but analysis by the SOLSPEC science team has already started in order to check the theoretical representation of the spatial distribution of the solar radiation on the solar disk, the observation could also be used in order to perform a verification of the value of the solar diameter.</description>

      <description>It was November 2/11/2000 that the first crew arrived at the ISS shown here in its first expedition configuration.
The three first ISS astronauts were : William Shepherd (commander, NASA), Sergei K.Krikalev (RSA) et Yuri Gidzenko (RSA). They prepared the station for further occupations and began the science programme of the ISS, since them a rotating cast of more than 220 of the world&amp;rsquo;s elite astronauts have lived and worked at the ISS, which includes 16 participating nations and is led by the United States and Russia.</description>

      <description>SOLAR on the ISS will observe the March 20 eclipse on the sun.
On March 20, there will be a coincidence between the International Space Station orbit and the path of the solar eclipse in Northern Africa. The SOLAR package on the ESA COLUMBUS module of the ISS will observe it. SOLAR operates for 7 years in earth orbit and measures the energy emitted by the sun for the far ultraviolet to the infrared in order to monitor the solar influence on atmospheric chemistry and climate.</description>

      <description>The SOLAR payload, located on one of the four external platforms of the Columbus module on the International Space Station, is active since February 2008 and measures the solar spectral irradiance with two instruments : SOLSPEC which covers the spectral range of the Ultra-Violet (UV) to the near infrared and SOL-ACES, a set of spectrometers measuring the Extreme UV radiation (EUV).
Due to the characteristics of the ISS orbit and the mechanical limitations for the platform, at most 20 minutes of measurements are possible per ISS revolution, and this for only 10 to 12 consecutive days per month.</description>

SPACELAB-1 was the first manned space mission involving several Belgian experiments in earth sciences, solar physics, microgravity and life sciences. In particular, two external payloads: SOLSPEC and SOLCON were quasi identical to instruments flown presently on the SOLAR payload on the ISS and which continue the series of solar irradiance observations initiated by this first mission.

      <description>The ISS astronauts stopped an ammonia leak in the ISS external cooling loop by replacing a suspected pump unit by the spare one and checking all connections on Saturday May 11.
http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition35/e35_051113_eva.html
This leak had appeared on May 9 and posed a threat to the ISS power conditioning as the main function of this cooling loop is to control the temperature of the electrical motors moving the solar panels. The coolant lines will have to be monitored for several weeks before it is certain that the leak has been fully fixed by the replacement and maintenance EVA of May 11.</description>

Being in space since February 2008, SOLAR will soon be celebrating its 5th birthday. &amp;laquo;This is quite an achievement&amp;raquo;, says Nadia This, operations engineer at B.USOC, &amp;laquo;since SOLAR was designed to operate for 18 months only.&amp;raquo;
The instruments on SOLAR observe the Sun, and due to the movement of the ISS, the instruments must be kept pointed at the Sun actively with a rotating platform, SOLAR.</description>

      <description>On May 17th, a unique collaboration between instruments on the ISS and Venus Express was set up. Between 19h00 and 22h30, SOLSPEC, in Earth-orbit on the ISS, and SPICAV, in Venus-orbit on Venus Express, were simultaneously observing the sun. The goal of this synchronisation is to perform an absolute calibration of SPICAV.
SOLSPEC is part of the SOLAR payload, mounted on the exterior of the Columbus Module of the ISS and operated by B.</description>
