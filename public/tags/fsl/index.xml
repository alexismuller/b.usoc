      <description>Science is running again on FSL! The Fluid Science Laboratory, onboard Columbus, was failing to downlink High Rate data for quite some time.
But yesterday, a workaround to get scientific videos on the ground was finally put in place and tested successfully with the Geoflow experiment, thanks to the perseverance and dedication of B.USOC engineers, professionalism of Airbus (Bremen) and of the Spanish USOC (E.USOC), and the great support and flexibility of the Columbus Control Centre.</description>

      <description>   Pedro Duque (crew representative) checked the VMU2 for its operationality (crew access to the unit, mating-demating of harnesses convenience) with respect to the crew activity in the ISS.
VMU2 will replace the current VMU (Video Management Unit) in the FSL in 2017.
Honoured to have @astro_duque with us @busoc_official yesterday for an #FSL #ISS crew inspection pic.twitter.com/Q57kQbGHau

      <description>   CIMEX (Convective Interfacial Mass EXperiment) is a MAP research program (Microgravity Application Promotion) funded by ESA and BELSPO and studies studies phase change phenomena and mass transfer through liquid-gas and liquid-liquid interfaces.
The removal of CIMEX scheduled from monday 18/01 to friday 22/01/2016.

      <description>April 21, 2015: first command sent to B.USOC to the ISS Fluid Science Laboratory (FSL).
In the morning of April 21, the B.USOC team successfully activated the FSL module in COLUMBUS and both sent test commands and received ancillary data leading to the start of a new activity in B.USOC. This successful end to end test prepares future science operations and is currently analysed in details.</description>
