      <description>The ESA British astronaut Tim Peake landed on June 18 after an extremely successful science mission oriented in large part towards the future manned exploration programme.
He conducted ESA experiments and the METERON Supvis-M test of driving a Martian lander mockup from the ISS in a realistic set-up in the dark.
Much more details can be seen on the mission web site: https://principia.org.uk/the-mission/ and http://blogs.esa.int/tim-peake/</description>

      <description>Tuesday 8 September 2015 will stay in the memories of many B.USOC operators for a long time! On that day, Flight Day 7 of the Short Duration Mission of the Danish astronaut Andreas Mogensen onboard the ISS, the operator team was engaged in two experiments successfully achieved.
That day, at the Belgian Control Centre, the SUPVIS-E experiment was accomplished with great success. The activity consisted of Andreas controlling the Eurobot rover located at ESTEC and executing a scenario including multiple robotic assets.</description>

      <description>Danish Astronaut Andreas Mogensen ready to conduct METERON and science operations from the ISS. The launch is scheduled on September 2.
On September 2, Danish ESA astronaut Andreas Mogensen will leave on a SOYUZ rocket to the ISS with fellow astronauts Sergei Volkov and Aidyn Aimbetov. During his stay on board the ISS, he will control the EUROBOT robot on ground at ESTEC in the METERON programme, with a new communications protocol adapted for space.</description>

      <description>NASA has developed a new manned spacecraft: ORION which will be the first since APOLLO to travel beyond the earth orbit with the moon, Mars or asteroids as destinations. These exploration targets are the future of manned exploration. The first unmanned test flight will take place in December this year from NASA Kennedy Space Center to recovery at sea in the Pacific Ocean.
Even without a payload we can participate by having NASA write our name on a memory chip which will be carried by ORION</description>

      <title>METERON: OPSCOM-2-video</title>

      <description>=
After the successful OPSCOM-2 test of August 7, ESA released a video showing the complex operations of the EUROBOT in ESTEC commanded by astronaut Alexander Gerst from the ISS using the Disruptive/Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) communication protocol.
METERON is a programme common to the ISS space agencies: NASA, ESA, Roscosmos and DLR developing the technology necessary for this objective by commanding a robot on earth by an astronaut on the ISS.</description>

      <description>Future human space exploration will most likely involve sending robots to explore the planetary surface, in preparation and support of the on-site exploration by humans.
The Meteron project is exactly preparing for that future. Use of robots will continue even when humans have safely landed for both astronaut support and planetary protection of â€œspecial regionsâ€ defined by the international treaties as hospitable for elementary life. Controlling the robots, even for short distances, would require a form of reliable internet to send commands and to receive information back.</description>
