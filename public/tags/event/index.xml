      <description>=
After the successful OPSCOM-2 test of August 7, ESA released a video showing the complex operations of the EUROBOT in ESTEC commanded by astronaut Alexander Gerst from the ISS using the Disruptive/Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) communication protocol.
METERON is a programme common to the ISS space agencies: NASA, ESA, Roscosmos and DLR developing the technology necessary for this objective by commanding a robot on earth by an astronaut on the ISS.</description>

      <description>Future human space exploration will most likely involve sending robots to explore the planetary surface, in preparation and support of the on-site exploration by humans.
The Meteron project is exactly preparing for that future. Use of robots will continue even when humans have safely landed for both astronaut support and planetary protection of â€œspecial regionsâ€ defined by the international treaties as hospitable for elementary life. Controlling the robots, even for short distances, would require a form of reliable internet to send commands and to receive information back.</description>
